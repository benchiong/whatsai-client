Use this to manage python backend, download files, start server, etc...
Treat it as a python extension of Node.js or shell program as AUTOMATIC1111 did in webui, 
because I am not familiar with shell as AUTOMATIC1111 does, so I choose this way to 
solve problem, hope it works.

package it as an executable file then copy to frontend and package them all.

how to package:

 pyinstaller --clean main.spec
