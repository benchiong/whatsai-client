# whatsai-client
A very easy to use AIGC UI client fully base on ComfyUI.
<img src="https://github.com/benchiong/whatsai-client/blob/main/images/whasai-cover.jpg">

WhatsAI is a client inspired by ComfyBox, without graph thing, just very normally UI with 
React/Next/Mantine;
WhatsAI's vision is to help everyone enjoy the pleasure of AIGC, if that's your interest too, feel free
to join me.
