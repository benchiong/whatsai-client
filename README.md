### Key Features
- Modern UI based on React/Mantine: sexy, simple and powerful 👠🪶💪 
- One-click installation, no complex scripts needed 🚀🚀🚀
- Excellent extensibility, easily turn any Comfy Workflow into a WhatsAI Card 🪄🧙‍♂️✨

### Swear Features
* WebUI/ComfyUI dir auto management, just tell WhatsAI where you put them, the models will be added;
* CivitAI model downloader, with file hash, WhatsAI will download the info for you, make models very beautiful 
* No workflow things, one workflow can be translated to a card in  WhatsAI, it's very cool both for common user
  and workflow developer, once published, share everywhere;
* Thanks ComfyUI, whatsAI's previewer is ready to use, no more other options;
* The Addons are very concept clear, LoRA/VAE/Contronet/UPScaler/Hypernet, and you can choose yourself very free,
  no need to figure out how it works,
* With the design of Comp, cards and addons are very Modular, with the design of Widget, backend can easily tell 
  backend how to render, cool thing~
* The cards pages already have SD1.x, SDXL, SD3 there, one click to generate, no more other work need, and more
  cards on the road, believe me!
* Come on and have a try, even it's buggy, but it's a very good start!!
* One more thing, WhatsAI is a client can be setup with one click, no terminal things at all, I almost forget it 
  because I always think it's a feature everyone will agree, LoL!
  [MacOS first version is ready, see realeas for detail]
