WhatsAI is a client inspired by ComfyBox, without complex graph nodes, just very brain friendly UI

WhatsAI's vision is to help everyone enjoy the pleasure of AI generated contents, if that's your interest too, feel free
to join me, let's do something really easy to use!

# Features
* WebUI/ComfyUI dir auto management, just tell WhatsAI where you put them, the models will be added;
* CivitAI model downloader, with file hash, WhatsAI will download the info for you, make models very beautiful 
* No workflow things, one workflow can be translated to a card in  WhatsAI, it's very cool both for common user
  and workflow developer, once published, share everywhere;
* Thanks ComfyUI, whatsAI's previewer is ready to use, no more other options;
* The Addons are very concept clear, LoRA/VAE/Contronet/UPScaler/Hypernet, and you can choose yourself very free,
  no need to figure out how it works,
* With the design of Comp, cards and addons are very Modular, with the design of Widget, backend can easily tell 
  backend how to render, cool thing~
* The cards pages already have SD1.x, SDXL, SD3 there, one click to generate, no more other work need, and more
  cards on the road, believe me!
* Come on and have a try, even it's buggy, but it's a very good start!!
* One more thing, WhatsAI is a client can be setup with one click, no terminal things at all, I almost forget it 
  because I always think it's a feature everyone will agree, LoL! [Still working on]
